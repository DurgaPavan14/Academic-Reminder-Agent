Academic Reminder Agent

Overview
The Academic Reminder Agent is an action-enabled AI assistant powered by OpenAI's function calling. It accepts user prompts like:

Remind me to submit my AI assignment on Friday and email my advisor.

The agent interprets the message and performs two real-world tasks:
- Creates a calendar event
- Sends an automated email to the advisor

Features
- Natural language understanding via OpenAI GPT-4
- Modular Python functions for email, calendar, and storage
- Logs all actions in a JSON file
- Easily extensible (Trello, Slack, DB integration, etc.)

Technologies
- Python 3
- OpenAI GPT-4 (function calling)
- JSON for local logging
- Modular file structure for scalability
